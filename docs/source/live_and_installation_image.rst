Live system and installation image
==================================

For the user who are not comfortable with the installation of
READemption, who want to run it under Windows or who just want to test
it without installation we offer a Ubuntu 14.4 based live system /
installation image (~ 1.2 GB large) which can be `downloaded here
<http://osimages.imib-zinf.net>`_. Once you have retrieved the image
you can either use it to install or test the system on a physical
machine or use it in a virtual machine (e.g. using the open source
software `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_). The required
installation/setup steps or live system instructions are the `same as
for the official Ubuntu version
<http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop>`_. The
only difference is once you have a running system READemption can be
used out of the box without any further setup.
