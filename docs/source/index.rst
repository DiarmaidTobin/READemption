TRAPL in a nutshell
===================

*The RNA-Seq Analysis PipeLine* (*TRAPL*) is - as the name implies - a
pipeline for the computational evaluation of RNA-Seq data. It was
originally developed at the `IMIB/ZINF
<http://www.imib-wuerzburg.de/>`_ to process dRNA-Seq reads (as
introduced by Sharma *et al.*, Nature, 2010 (`Pubmed
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164839>`_)) originating from
bacterial samples. Meanwhile is has been extended to process data
generated in different experimental setups and originating from all
domains of life and is under `active developtment
<https://github.com/konrad/trapl>`_. The `subcommands
<subcommands.html>`_ which are provided by command-line interface
cover read processing and aligning, coverage plot generation, gene
expression quantification as well as differential gene expression
analysis. TRAPL was applied to analyze numerous data sets. In order to
set up analyses quickly TRAPL follows the principal of *convention
over configuration*: Once the input files are copied into defined
folders no further parameters have to be given. Still, TRAPL's
behavior can be adapted to specific needs of the user. This tools is
available as open source under the `ICS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license>`_
open source license.

Download

TRAPL can be download from `its PyPI page
